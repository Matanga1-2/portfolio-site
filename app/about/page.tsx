              I&apos;m a versatile Product Manager with over six years of experience in both B2B and B2C environments.

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              My unique expertise lies in extreme communication and responsiveness, cross-functional collaboration, and excellence in execution.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                I currently lead two Product Teams at Port (B2B SaaS), building an internal developer portal to improve developer experience. With over seven years of experience as a Product Manager, I&apos;m always looking for ways to become more efficient and optimize my work. My passion lies in scaling, launching, and executing complex products that deliver value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Before Port, I worked at Lusha (B2B SaaS), where I led scalable platform and infrastructure initiatives. I launched two major infrastructure upgrades that reduced maintenance costs by 30% and supported company growth.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Prior to that, my main growth happened at theLotter, a lottery-gaming product, where I focused on the checkout area, processing $80M ARR, improving payment acceptance rates, integrating new vendors and payment options, and leading a new design system and site architecture.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Throughout my career, I&apos;ve been driven by a desire to enhance efficiency and deliver impactful solutions. I&apos;m excited to continue this journey at Port, contributing to the next generation of developer experience.
