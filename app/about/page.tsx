              <p className="text-gray-300">
                I currently lead AI initiatives and product teams at Port, building internal developer portals that transform how engineering teams work. I launched one of the first AI agents and MCP server in that space along with my amazing team. With seven years of product management experience, I focus on executing complex products that deliver measurable value and drive clear business outcomes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Before Port, I worked at Lusha, where I led scalable platform and infrastructure initiatives. I launched two major infrastructure upgrades that reduced maintenance costs by 30% and supported company growth.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Prior to that, I grew my expertise at theLotter, focusing on the checkout area processing $80M ARR. I improved payment acceptance rates, integrated new vendors and payment options, and led a comprehensive design system and site architecture overhaul.

              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Throughout my career, I&apos;ve been driven by a desire to enhance efficiency and deliver impactful solutions that solve real problems for users and businesses.
