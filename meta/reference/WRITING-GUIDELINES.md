# Writing Guidelines: Human-First Communication

This document defines writing standards for all content on the portfolio site. The goal is clear, authentic, human-like writing.

## Core Principle

Write like a knowledgeable professional, not a marketing brochure. Be direct, specific, and natural.

## Critical Patterns to AVOID

### 1. Em Dash Overuse (—)
**Rule**: Max 1-2 per paragraph. Prefer commas, parentheses, or sentence breaks.

### 2. ALL CAPS Emphasis
**Rule**: No ALL CAPS except acronyms (API, AI, SDLC).

### 3. Inflated Language
**Avoid**:
- "stands as a testament to"
- "plays a vital role"
- "paradigm shift"
- "game-changer"

### 4. Promotional Language
**Avoid**:
- "world-class"
- "cutting-edge"
- "stunning"
- "must-have"

### 5. Meta-Commentary
**Avoid**:
- "it's important to note"
- "let's explore"
- "in this article"

### 6. Hollow Verbs
**Avoid overuse of**:
- "ensuring"
- "highlighting"
- "showcasing"
- "demonstrating"

## Positive Practices

### Lead with Outcomes
State the goal first, then the method.

### Use Concrete Language
Be specific. "Automates incident response" beats "provides comprehensive capabilities."

### Write in Active Voice
"Agents use context" not "Context is used by agents."

### Vary Sentence Length
Mix short and long. Break up rhythm.

## Title Casing

**Use sentence case for all titles** - capitalize only the first word and proper nouns/names.

✅ **Do**:
- "AI agents took control of our WhatsApp chat" (WhatsApp is a proper noun)
- "How I choose which LLM to use" (LLM is an acronym)
- "Claude Code for retro games" (Claude Code is a product name)
- "Port as context lake for workflows" (Port is a company name)

❌ **Don't**:
- "AI Agents Took Control of Our WhatsApp Chat"
- "How I Choose Which LLM To Use"

**What stays uppercase**:
- Product names: Claude, Port, Google, Reddit, EvalKit
- Acronyms: AI, LLM, MCP, API, DORA
- First word of the title

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### Blog Post Summaries
- 2-3 sentences max
- Capture the main point
- Create interest without spoilers
- No hype or exaggeration

### Media Descriptions
- What was discussed
- Key takeaways
- Why it's worth consuming

### Bio/About Content
- Professional but approachable
- Specific accomplishments
- Builder mindset, not corporate speak

## Quick Check

Before publishing:
- Does it sound like a human wrote it?
- Can you remove adjectives without losing meaning?
- Is it specific rather than vague?
